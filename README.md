# TraitSDM
Trait-SDM is a general framework of modelling that uses Generalised Additive Models to predict species-specific abundance changes and community-level biodiversity responses. 
HTML files contain all the data, code, and results generated during our analysis. Each HTML file is specific to the species analysed, encompassing everything from data exploratory analyses to GAM outputs.
